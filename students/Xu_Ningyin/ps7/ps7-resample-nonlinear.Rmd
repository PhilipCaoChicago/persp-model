# Part 1: Sexy Joe Biden (redux) [4 points]

![](http://i.giphy.com/5of8ya8s34JQA.gif)

[Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden) was the 47th Vice President of the United States. He was the subject of [many memes](http://distractify.com/trending/2016/11/16/best-of-joe-and-obama-memes), [attracted the attention of Leslie Knope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbMB_GGR6s), and [experienced a brief surge in attention due to photos from his youth](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-young-hot_us_58262f53e4b0c4b63b0c9e11).

This sounds like a repeat, because it is. You previously estimated a series of linear regression models based on the Biden dataset. Now we will revisit that approach and implement resampling methods to validate our original findings.

`biden.csv` contains a selection of variables from the [2008 American National Election Studies survey](http://www.electionstudies.org/) that allow you to test competing factors that may influence attitudes towards Joe Biden. The variables are coded as follows:

* `biden` - feeling thermometer ranging from 0-100^[Feeling thermometers are a common metric in survey research used to gauge attitudes or feelings of warmth towards individuals and institutions. They range from 0-100, with 0 indicating extreme coldness and 100 indicating extreme warmth.]
* `female` - 1 if respondent is female, 0 if respondent is male
* `age` - age of respondent in years
* `dem` - 1 if respondent is a Democrat, 0 otherwise
* `rep` - 1 if respondent is a Republican, 0 otherwise
* `educ` - number of years of formal education completed by respondent
    * `17` - 17+ years (aka first year of graduate school and up)

For this exercise we consider the following functional form:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_1 + \beta_{2}X_2 + \beta_{3}X_3 + \beta_{4}X_4 + \beta_{5}X_5 + \epsilon$$

where $Y$ is the Joe Biden feeling thermometer, $X_1$ is age, $X_2$ is gender, $X_3$ is education, $X_4$ is Democrat, and $X_5$ is Republican.^[Independents must be left out to serve as the baseline category, otherwise we would encounter perfect multicollinearity.] Report the parameters and standard errors.

1. Estimate the training MSE of the model using the traditional approach.
    * Fit the linear regression model using the entire dataset and calculate the mean squared error for the training set.
1. Estimate the test MSE of the model using the validation set approach.
    * Split the sample set into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). **Be sure to set your seed prior to this part of your code to guarantee reproducibility of results.**
    * Fit the linear regression model using only the training observations.
    * Calculate the MSE using only the test set observations.
    * How does this value compare to the training MSE from step 1?
1. Repeat the validation set approach 100 times, using 100 different splits of the observations into a training set and a validation set. Comment on the results obtained.
1. Estimate the test MSE of the model using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. Comment on the results obtained.
1. Estimate the test MSE of the model using the $10$-fold cross-validation approach. Comment on the results obtained.
1. Repeat the $10$-fold cross-validation approach 100 times, using 100 different splits of the observations into $10$-folds. Comment on the results obtained.
1. Compare the estimated parameters and standard errors from the original model in step 1 (the model estimated using all of the available data) to parameters and standard errors estimated using the bootstrap ($n = 1000$).

# Part 2: Wage [3 points]

The `Wage` dataset in the `ISLR` library (also available as a `.csv` or [`.feather`](https://github.com/wesm/feather) file in the `data` folder) contains detailed information on wages and other information for a group of 3000 workers in the Mid-Atlantic region.

* `year` - Year that wage information was recorded
* `age` - Age of worker
* `sex` - Gender
* `maritl` - A factor with five levels:
    1. Never married
    1. Married
    1. Widowed
    1. Divorced
    1. Separated
* `race` - A factor with four levels:
    1. White
    1. Black
    1. Asian
    1. Other
* `education` - A factor with five levels:
    1. < HS Grad
    1. HS Grad
    1. Some College
    1. College Grad
    1. Advanced degree
* `region` - Region of the country (mid-atlantic only).
* `jobclass` - A factor with two levels indicating type of job:
    1. Industrial
    1. Information
* `health` - A factor with two levels indicating health level of worker:
    1. <= Good
    1. >= Very Good
* `health_ins` - A factor with two levels indicating whether worker has health insurance:
    1. Yes
    1. No
* `logwage` - Log of worker's wage.
* `wage` - Worker's raw wage.

Explore the bivariate relationships between some of the available predictors and `wage`. You should estimate at least 3 **simple** linear regression models (i.e. only one predictor per model). Use non-linear fitting techniques in order to fit a flexible model to the data, **as appropriate**. You could consider any of the following techniques:

* No transformation
* Monotonic transformation
* Polynomial regression
* Step functions
* Splines
* Local regression

Justify your use of linear or non-linear techniques using cross-validation methods. Create plots of the results obtained, and write a summary of your findings.

# Part 3: College [3 points]

The `College` dataset in the `ISLR` library (also available as a `.csv` or [`.feather`](https://github.com/wesm/feather) file in the `data` folder) contains statistics for a large number of U.S. colleges from the 1995 issue of U.S. News and World Report. The variables we are most concerned with are:

* `Outstate` - Out-of-state tuition.
* `Private` - A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating private or public university.
* `Room.board` - Room and board costs.
* `PhD` - Percent of faculty with Ph.D.'s.
* `perc.alumni` - Percent of alumni who donate.
* `Expend` - Instructional expenditure per student.
* `Grad.Rate` - Graduation rate.

1. Split the data into a training set and a test set.
1. Estimate an OLS model on the training data, using out-of-state tuition (`Outstate`) as the response variable and the other six variables as the predictors. Interpret the results and explain your findings, using appropriate techniques (tables, graphs, statistical tests, etc.).
1. Estimate a GAM on the training data, using out-of-state tuition (`Outstate`) as the response variable and the other six variables as the predictors. You can select any non-linear method presented in the readings or in-class to fit each variable. Plot the results, and explain your findings. Interpret the results and explain your findings, using appropriate techniques (tables, graphs, statistical tests, etc.).
1. Use the test set to evaluate the model fit of the estimated OLS and GAM models, and explain the results obtained.
1. For which variables, if any, is there evidence of a non-linear relationship with the response?^[Hint: Review Ch. 7.8.3 from ISL on how you can use ANOVA tests to determine if a non-linear relationship is appropriate for a given variable.]

# Submission instructions

Assignment submission will work the same as earlier assignments. Submit your work as a pull request before the start of class on Monday. Store it in the same locations as you've been using. However the format of your submission should follow the procedures outlined below.

## If you use R

Submit your assignment as a single [R Markdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). R Markdown is similar to Juptyer Notebooks and compiles all your code, output, and written analysis in a single reproducible file.

## If you use Python

Either:

1. Submit your assignment following the same procedures as required by Dr. Evans. Submit a Python script containing all your code, plus a $\LaTeX$ generated PDF document with your results and substantive analysis.
1. Submit your assignment as a single Jupyter Notebook with your code, output, and written analysis compiled there.
