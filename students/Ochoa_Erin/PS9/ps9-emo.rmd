# Attitudes towards feminists


## Split the data into a training and test set (70/30%)

We read in the data:

```{r read_data_fem}

fem = read.csv('data/feminist.csv')
```

Next, we split the dataset into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3:

```{r fem_split}

set.seed(1234)

fem_split7030 = resample_partition(fem, c(test = 0.3, train = 0.7))
fem_train70 = fem_split7030$train %>%
              tbl_df()
fem_test30 = fem_split7030$test %>%
             tbl_df()
```

## Calculate the test MSE for KNN models with $K = 5, 10, 15, \dots, 100$, using whatever combination of variables you see fit. Which model produces the lowest test MSE?

Using female, education, income, Democrat, and Republican, we calculate the test MSE for KNN models with K ranging from [5,100] in 5-point increments:

```{r fem_knn}
fem_knn = data_frame(k = seq(5, 100, by = 5), 
                     knn = map(k, ~ knn.reg(select(fem_train70, -feminist, -age),
                                            y = fem_train70$feminist,
                                            test = select(fem_test30, -feminist, -age), k = .)), 
                     mse = map_dbl(knn, ~ mean((fem_test30$feminist - .$pred)^2))) 
```

The models with K=35, K=40, and K=50 produce the lowest MSE (`r min(fem_knn$mse)`).  Next, we plot the MSE for each model:

```{r fem_knn_plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(fem_knn, aes(k, mse)) +
  geom_line(color='darkturquoise', size=1) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, color='deeppink') +
  labs(title = "Test MSE for KNN models",
       subtitle = "Attitude Toward Feminists Based on Gender, Education, Income, & Party Affiliation",
       x = "Using K Nearest Neighbors",
       y = "Test MSE") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
             panel.border = element_rect(linetype = "solid", color = "grey70", fill=NA, size=1.1)) +
       scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100,by=10)) +
       scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(440,510,by=10))
```

## Compare the test MSE for the best KNN/wKNN model(s) to the test MSE for the equivalent linear regression, decision tree, boosting, and random forest methods using the same combination of variables as before. Which performs the best? Why do you think this method performed the best, given your knowledge of how it works?
fem_train70, -feminist, -age
```{r fem_weighted_knn}
fem_w_knn = data_frame(k = seq(5, 100, by = 5), 
                       wknn = map(k, ~ kknn(feminist ~ female + educ + income + dem + rep,
                                            train = fem_train70, test = fem_test30, k = .)), 
                       mse_wknn = map_dbl(wknn, ~ mean((fem_test30$feminist - .$fitted.values)^2))) %>%
            left_join(fem_knn, by = "k") %>%
            mutate(fem_knn = mse)%>%
            select(k, fem_knn, mse_wknn) %>%
            gather(method, mse, -k) %>%

            mutate(Method = factor(method, levels = c("fem_knn","wknn"), labels = c("KNN","Weighted KNN")))
```

`feminist.csv` contains a selection of variables from the [2008 American National Election Studies survey](http://www.electionstudies.org/) that allow you to test competing factors that may influence attitudes towards feminists. The variables are coded as follows:

* `feminist` - feeling thermometer ranging from 0-100^[Feeling thermometers are a common metric in survey research used to gauge attitudes or feelings of warmth towards individuals and institutions. They range from 0-100, with 0 indicating extreme coldness and 100 indicating extreme warmth.]
* `female` - 1 if respondent is female, 0 if respondent is male
* `age` - age of respondent in years
* `dem` - 1 if respondent is a Democrat, 0 otherwise
* `rep` - 1 if respondent is a Republican, 0 otherwise
* `educ` - number of years of formal education completed by respondent
    * `17` - 17+ years (aka first year of graduate school and up)
* `income` - ordinal variable indicating respondent's income

# Voter turnout and depression [2 points]

The 1998 General Social Survey included several questions about the respondent's mental health. `mental_health.csv` reports several important variables from this survey.

* `vote96` - 1 if the respondent voted in the 1996 presidential election, 0 otherwise
* `mhealth_sum` - index variable which assesses the respondent's mental health, ranging from 0 (an individual with no depressed mood) to 9 (an individual with the most severe depressed mood)^[The variable is an index which combines responses to four different questions: "In the past 30
days, how often did you feel: 1) so sad nothing could cheer you up, 2) hopeless, 3) that everything was an effort, and 4) worthless?" Valid responses are none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, and all of the time.]
* `age` - age of the respondent
* `educ` - Number of years of formal education completed by the respondent
* `black` - 1 if the respondent is black, 0 otherwise
* `female` - 1 if the respondent is female, 0 if male
* `married` - 1 if the respondent is currently married, 0 otherwise
* `inc10` - Family income, in \$10,000s

# Colleges

The `College` dataset in the `ISLR` library contains statistics for a large number of U.S. colleges from the 1995 issue of U.S. News and World Report.

* `Private` - A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating private or public university.
* `Apps` - Number of applications received.
* `Accept` - Number of applications accepted.
* `Enroll` - Number of new students enrolled.
* `Top10perc` - Percent of new students from top 10% of H.S. class.
* `Top25perc` - Percent of new students from top 25% of H.S. class.
* `F.Undergrad` - Number of fulltime undergraduates.
* `P.Undergrad` - Number of parttime undergraduates.
* `Outstate` - Out-of-state tuition.
* `Room.Board` - Room and board costs.
* `Books` - Estimated book costs.
* `Personal` - Estimated personal spending.
* `PhD` - Percent of faculty with Ph.D.'s.
* `Terminal` - Percent of faculty with terminal degrees.
* `S.F.Ratio` - Student/faculty ratio.
* `perc.alumni` - Percent of alumni who donate.
* `Expend` - Instructional expenditure per student.
* `Grad.Rate` - Graduation rate.

Perform PCA analysis on the college dataset and plot the first two principal components. Describe the results. What variables appear strongly correlated on the first principal component? What about the second principal component?

We assign the dataframe (imported via the ISLR library) to a new object and recode the Private variable to be numeric:

```{r get_data_college}

college = College
college$Private = as.numeric(college$Private)
```

Next, we perform principal component analysis and view the loadings for the first two components:

```{r college_pca_1_2}
college_pca = prcomp(college, scale = TRUE)
college_pca_1_2 = as.data.frame(college_pca$rotation)[1:2]
college_pca_1_2
```

Because 

For the first component, Top10perc and Top25perc load very negatively, suggesting that schools with high scores for PC1 will have low proportions of students in the top 10% or top 25% of their high-school classes.  Similarly, Outstate, Expend, PhD, and Terminal also load very negatively, indicating that schools with high scores for PC1 will have high proportions of in-state students, low per-student expenditure, and low proportions of faculty with PhDs or terminal degrees.

For the second component, F.Undergrad loads highly negatively, suggesting that schools with high scores for PC2 will have low enrollment of full-time undergraduates.  Private loads positively, suggesting that schools with high scores for this component will tend to be private.  Enroll, Accept, and Apps load very negatively; schools with high scores for PC2 should enroll few new students, accept few applications, and receive few applications.

* `Private` - A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating private or public university.
* `Apps` - Number of applications received.
* `Accept` - Number of applications accepted.
* `Enroll` - Number of new students enrolled.
* `Top10perc` - Percent of new students from top 10% of H.S. class.
* `Top25perc` - Percent of new students from top 25% of H.S. class.
* `F.Undergrad` - Number of fulltime undergraduates.
* `P.Undergrad` - Number of parttime undergraduates.
* `Outstate` - Out-of-state tuition.
* `Room.Board` - Room and board costs.
* `Books` - Estimated book costs.
* `Personal` - Estimated personal spending.
* `PhD` - Percent of faculty with Ph.D.'s.
* `Terminal` - Percent of faculty with terminal degrees.
* `S.F.Ratio` - Student/faculty ratio.
* `perc.alumni` - Percent of alumni who donate.
* `Expend` - Instructional expenditure per student.
* `Grad.Rate` - Graduation rate.

1. Perform $K$-means clustering with $K=3$ on the first two principal components score vectors, rather than the raw data. Describe your results and compare them to the clustering results with $K=3$ based on the raw data.
1. Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.
1. Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?
1. Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation $1$. What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed? Provide a justification for your answer.
